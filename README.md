# WHAT IS A COMPILER?
# A compiler translates a source file into an executable file.
# A compiler translates the whole program into machine code before the program is run.
# It can be difficult to test individual lines of compiled code compared to interpreted languages as all bugs are
# reported after the program has been compiled.
# The machine code is saved and stored separately to the high-level code. Compilation is slow but machine code can be
# executed quickly.
# Java and C++ are compiled programming languages. Java is a high-level programming language which is compiled to
# produce bytecode which is then interpreted by a virtual machine (VM). Bytecode is code which is compiled and can then
# be interpreted.

# WHAT IS AN INTERPRETER?
# An interpreter translates a source file into machine language as the program executes.
# The source file itself is the executable file, but it must be interpreted each time a user executes it.
# An interpreter translates code into machine code, instruction by instruction - the CPU executes each instruction
# before the interpreter moves on to translate the next instruction. Interpreted code will show an error as soon as it
# hits a problem, so it is easier to debug than compiled code.
# An interpreter does not create an independent final set of source code - source code is created each time it runs.
# Interpreted code is slower to execute than compiled code.

# Interpreted languages include JavaScript, PHP, Python and Ruby. Interpreted languages are also called scripting
# languages. These are ideal for using within dynamic web applications. They are used for client-side and server-side
# coding, as they are small programs that are executed within the browser.

# STATEMENTS AND EXPRESSIONS?
# A statement is a complete line of code that performs some action, while an expression is any section of the
# code that evaluates to a value.
